# cryoEM-dynPHD/flexible_fitting-constricted_dynamin-assembly

This folder contains three folders that contains the raw files generated from flexible fitting of
individual dynamin dimers found inside the Cryo-EM map of the GMPPCP-bound human dynamin-1 
polymer assembled on the membrane in the constricted state{1} (https://www.emdataresource.org/EMD-7957).
The initial configurations of the individual dimers have been from the output from rigid-body fitting algorithm{2} 
(https://chaconlab.org/hybrid4em/adp-em). The flexible fitting was performed using iMODFIT tool{3}.
