rigid_body_fitting-constricted_dynamin-assembly (folder)

This folder contains the various configurations of dynamin obtained by rigid body fitting of the 
model 6DLU (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6DLU) inside the Cryo-EM map of the GMPPCP-bound human dynamin-1 
polymer assembled on the membrane in the constricted state{1} (https://www.emdataresource.org/EMD-7957) 

A total of 26 dynamin dimers were found in the map using rigid-body fitting algorithm{2} (https://chaconlab.org/hybrid4em/adp-em).
These dynamin dimers were used as initial configurations for flexible fitting.
